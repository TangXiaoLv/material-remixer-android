Remixer is a framework to iterate quickly on UI changes by allowing you to adjust UI variables without needing to rebuild (or even restart) your app. You can adjust Numbers, Colors, Booleans, and Strings. To see it in action check out the [example app](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-android/tree/develop/remixer_example).

If you are interested in using Remixer in another platform, you may want to check out the [iOS](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-ios) and [Javascript](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-js) repos. With any of the three platforms you can use the [Remote Controller](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-remote-web).
